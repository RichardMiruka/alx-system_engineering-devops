### Processes:
In computing, a process is a program in execution. It represents a unit of work that the operating system manages. When you run a program on your computer, it creates a process. A process includes the program code, its data, and the resources (such as memory, CPU time, files, etc.) it needs to execute.

Key aspects of a process include: 
* Memory Space: A process has its own memory space, allowing it to run independently without interfering with other processes.
* Execution State: The current state of the program, including the values of variables, registers, and the program counter.
* Resources: Processes have access to various resources such as file handles, network connections, and input/output streams.

Processes enable concurrent execution, enabling multiple programs to run simultaneously, which is essential for multitasking operating systems.

### Signals:

In the context of operating systems and programming, a signal is a software interrupt delivered to a process, indicating an event that has occurred. Signals are a form of inter-process communication and are used to notify a process of various conditions, such as errors, alarms, or specific events.

Common uses of signals include:
* Error Handling: Signals can be used to notify a process of an error condition, allowing the program to take appropriate actions.
* Termination: Signals can instruct a process to terminate gracefully.
* User Interaction: Signals can be triggered by user actions, like pressing Ctrl+C to interrupt a running program.
  
Each signal has a unique identifier and a predefined meaning, and it can be caught and handled by the process or allowed to take its default action.

* [Daemon](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/kCoQ5aYO3towdDQFVPcfNg) Programs that are detached from the terminal and running in the background are called daemons or processes, need to be managed. The general minimum set of instructions is: start, restart and stop. The most popular way of doing so on Unix system is to use the init scripts.
